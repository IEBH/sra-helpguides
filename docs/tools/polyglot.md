# Polyglot
The Polyglot Search Translator or simply, Polyglot, is designed to translate search strings across databases to aid with running searches for systematic reviews. The Polyglot translates either a PubMed or Ovid MEDLINE search string into the following database platforms; the Cochrane Library; Embase (via Elsevier); Web of Science; Scopus; EBSCO (e.g. CINAHL); Ovid (e.g. PsycINFO or Embase via Ovid) and PubMed.

It is important to note that it does not remove the need to understand how the databases work. For instance the Polyglot does not automatically map subject terms across databases (e.g. MeSH terms to Emtree terms). It is recommended that people have a basic understanding of how each database works, before using the Polyglot.
